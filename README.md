This is a modification of existing code that allows the user to create a random password based on criteria.
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are prompted to input how long their password will be (8-128 characters). After, they are prompted to choose whether their password will contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. Based on their input, the app will generate a random password at the desired length using the characters the user selected.
